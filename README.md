# Interactive-map-Covid-19
Interactive chloropeth map 

PROJECT
As part of Stanford's CS106A Code In Place, I created an interactive chloropeth map for my final project. 
In this time of coronavirus Covid-19 pandemic, I decided to show the cumulative confirmed cases of Covid-19 over a time period (from January 1st, 2020, to May 17th).

TOOLS & DATA
Different libraries are used : 
- Geopandas library : to read the shapefile (file containing the world map's geospatial coordinates and shapes.
- Pandas : to read the csv file and shape the datasets.
- Bokeh : to visualize interactive data.
- Covid19 data : found on Our World In Data (OWID) website.
- Shapefile : Natural Earth website.
